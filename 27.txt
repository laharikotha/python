//You are given a spreadsheet that contains a list of N athletes and their details (such as age, height, weight and so on). You are required to sort the data based on the K th attribute and print the final resulting table. Follow the example given below for better understanding.

  rank    age   height(in cm)            		 rank
	1	32	190					5
	2	35	175			sort		4
	3	41	188			based		1
	4	26	195			on k=1	2
	5	24	176					3
Note that K is indexed from 0 to M-1, where M is the number of attributes.

Note: If two attributes are the same for different rows, for example, if two atheletes are of the same age, print the row that appeared first in the input.//


coding:

#!/bin/python3
# initiailzing map function
N, M = map(int, input().split())

# taking for rows
rows = [input() for _ in range(N)]

# taking input from user
K = int(input())


# sorting using sorted function
for row in sorted(rows, key=lambda row: int(row.split()[K])):
    print(row)
