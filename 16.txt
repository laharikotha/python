There is an array of  integers. There are also2  disjoint sets, A and B , each containing m integers. You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. For each i integer in the array, if iE A , you add 1 to your happiness. If i E B , you add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

Note: Since A and B  are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain duplicate elements.

Constraints
1<=n<=10 power 5
1<=m<=10 power 5
1<=any integer in the input<=10 power 9

coding:
# importing the counter method
from collections import Counter

# using map method for mapping
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# convetring the mapping to list
data = list(map(int, input().split()))

# using conter method
data_counter = Counter(data)
data_set = set(data)

# taking inputs from user
set_a = set(map(int, input().split()))
set_b = set(map(int, input().split()))

# initializing happiness to 0
happiness = 0

# using for loop
for i in data_set & set_a:
    happiness += data_counter[i]
for i in data_set & set_b:
    happiness -= data_counter[i]
    
# printing the output
print(happiness)
