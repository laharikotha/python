//The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.//

coding:

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from collections import defaultdict
input_n, input_m = map(int, input().split())
