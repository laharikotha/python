//In this task, we would like for you to appreciate the usefulness of the groupby() function of itertools . To read more about this function, Check this out .

You are given a string S. Suppose a character 'c' occurs consecutively X times in the string. Replace these consecutive occurrences of the character 'c' with (X,c)  in the string.

For a better understanding of the problem, check the explanation.//


coding:

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# importing the groupby method
from itertools import groupby

# using for loop to iterate through the string
for k, c in groupby(input()):
        
    #printing the output
    print("(%d, %d)" % (len(list(c)), int(k)), end=' ')
