//Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is:2 power 31 - 1  (c++ int) or 2 power - 1 (C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of a power b grows really fast with increasing b.

Let's do some calculations on very large integers.//


coding:

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
C = int(input())
D = int(input())

print((A**B)+(C**D))

Input (stdin)
