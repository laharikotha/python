//Read in two integers, a and b, and print three lines.
The first line is the integer division a//b (While using Python2 remember to import division from __future__).
The second line is the result of the modulo operator:a%b .
The third line prints the divmod of a and b.//

coding:

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

a = int(input());
b = int(input());
print(a//b);
print(a%b);
print(divmod(a,b));
