//Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.//

code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    scores = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input()) 
        scores.append([name, score])
    
    # Find min score
    min_score = min(scores, key = lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Keep only students with score higher than min
    scores = [score for score in scores if score[1] > min_score[1]]
    
    # Find second min score
    second_min_score = min(scores, key = lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Keep only students with second min score
    scores = [score for score in scores if score[1] == second_min_score[1]]
    
    # Sort students alphabetically
    scores.sort(key = lambda x: x[0])
    
    for score in scores:
        print(score[0])
