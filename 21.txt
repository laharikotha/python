You are given a positive integer N .
Your task is to print a palindromic triangle of size N.

For example, a palindromic triangle of size 5 is:

1
121
12321
1234321
123454321
You can't take more than two lines. The first line (a for-statement) is already written for you.
You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement.



coding:


for i in range(1,int(input())+1): #More than 2 lines will result in 0 score. Do not leave a blank line also
    print((10 ** i - 1) ** 2 // 81)



Input (stdin)
5



Expected Output
1
121
12321
1234321
123454321
