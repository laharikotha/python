Subject 1   |  89    90    78    93    80
Subject 2   |  90    91    85    88    86  
Subject 3   |  91    92    83    89    90.5

Average        90    91    82    90    //


coding:

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
N, X = input().split()
io = list()
for _ in range(int(X)):
    ip = map(float, input().split())
    io.append(ip)
for i in zip(*io): 
    print( sum(i)/len(i) )
